About
^^^^^

On November 12th, 2024, the `.NET team <https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/author/dotnet/>`_ announced the release of the `.NET 9`_ framework:

* `Announcing .NET 9 | .NET Blog <https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-dotnet-9/>`_

This major release upgrades `Ocelot`_ package `TFMs <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/frameworks#latest-versions>`_ to ``net9.0`` in addition to the current ``net8.0``.
Thus, the current Ocelot `supported frameworks <https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/platform/support/policy/dotnet-core#lifecycle>`_ are .NET 8 LTS and .NET 9 STS.
According to the `.NET Support Policy <https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/platform/support/policy>`_, the Ocelot team has discontinued support of .NET 6 and .NET 7 by providing the version `23.4.3`_ which targets those .NET versions.
